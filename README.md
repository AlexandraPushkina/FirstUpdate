<b>ABC-HELPER</b>

This application processes the text and brings the verbs to the form (...,...,...), 
and the user needs to choose the correct verb in this place. The user can type in the text by himself (it is assumed that he will take a random text from the Internet) 
or use the RandomText button to select text on a specific topic. The prepared texts, the list of verbs, the history of user texts, the user name, passwords are stored in the MySQL database

<b>1. INSERT TEXT </b>

1.1 Just write the text and the verbs (the most common ones are recorded in the database) will be converted.

<b>2. RANDOM TEXT </b>
